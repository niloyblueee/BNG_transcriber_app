 <h1> BRANSCRIBER </h1>

**Why?** <br>
well how many transcriber solely focuses on Bangla Language?
(**NB:** It supports all the other languages too, and it auto detects so dont worry about choosing anything.)
 
**Main Purpouse?** <br>
well, if you are in a meeting or in a class and you had a very rough night , you need something to back you off . So here it is !
Although there are lots of same webapps and even apps such as this. I also made this for the sake of **ease off use**.

**Do i store your voice ?** <br>
